# Random Forest Regression Model Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the Random Forest regression model implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `Random Forest Tree.ipynb`. The Random Forest model is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting. It is widely used for regression tasks due to its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships.

## 1. Data Import
The necessary libraries are imported, and the dataset `Position_Salaries.csv` is loaded into a DataFrame.

## 2. Data Exploration
Basic data exploration is performed to understand the dataset:
- `df.head()`: Displays the first few rows of the dataset.
- `df.describe()`: Provides summary statistics of the dataset.
- `df.info()`: Displays information about the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts.
- `df.isnull().sum()`: Checks for missing values in the dataset.
- `df.duplicated().sum()`: Checks for duplicate entries in the dataset.

## 3. Data Preparation
The feature and target variables are reshaped for the model:
- `X`: Feature variable (Level) is reshaped to a 2D array.
- `y`: Target variable (Salary) is reshaped to a 2D array.

## 4. Model Training
A `RandomForestRegressor` model is initialized and fitted to the training data:
- The model is configured with `n_estimators=10` and a random state for reproducibility.

## 5. Prediction
The model is used to make predictions for specific input values, such as predicting the salary for a level of 6.5.

## 6. Visualization
The results are visualized using matplotlib:
- A scatter plot displays the actual data points.
- A line plot shows the model's predictions across the range of input values.

## Conclusion
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Random Forest regression model implementation. The model effectively predicts salaries based on levels, demonstrating the power of ensemble learning techniques in regression tasks.
