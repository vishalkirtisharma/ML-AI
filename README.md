# Project Documentation

## Introduction
This project implements various machine learning models to predict outcomes based on input features. The first model implemented is a simple linear regression model that predicts salaries based on years of experience.

## Simple Linear Regression
The simple linear regression model predicts salaries based on the number of years of experience. It utilizes a dataset containing salary information and applies linear regression techniques to establish a relationship between experience and salary.

## Future Additions
This section will be updated with additional models and functionalities as the project expands. Future models may include multiple linear regression, decision trees, and more.
