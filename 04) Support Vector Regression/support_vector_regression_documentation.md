# Support Vector Regression (SVR) Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model implemented in the Jupyter notebook. SVR is a type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that is used for regression tasks. It aims to find a function that deviates from the actual observed targets (y) by a value no greater than a specified margin (epsilon).

## Steps in the Notebook

### 1. Importing Libraries
The following libraries are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and model training:
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data handling and analysis.
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot`: For data visualization.
- `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`: For feature scaling.
- `sklearn.svm.SVR`: For implementing the SVR model.

### 2. Data Loading
The dataset "Position_Salaries.csv" is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Basic information about the dataset is displayed using:
- `df.info()`: Provides a summary of the DataFrame.
- `df.describe()`: Generates descriptive statistics.
- `df.head()`: Displays the first few rows of the dataset.
- `df.isnull().sum()`: Checks for any missing values.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- The feature (X) and target (y) variables are extracted and reshaped.
- Feature scaling is applied to both X and y using `StandardScaler` to improve the performance of the SVR model.

### 4. Model Training
An SVR model is initialized with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and fitted to the scaled data.

### 5. Visualization
The results of the SVR model are visualized:
- The original data points are plotted in red.
- The SVR model predictions are plotted in blue, showing how well the model fits the data.

## Conclusion
This documentation outlines the key steps taken to implement the SVR model. The model effectively captures the relationship between position levels and salaries, providing a smooth prediction curve.

## Future Work
- Experiment with different kernels and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Evaluate the model using cross-validation techniques.
