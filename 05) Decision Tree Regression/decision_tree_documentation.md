# Decision Tree Regression Documentation

## Introduction
Decision tree regression is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for regression tasks. It models the relationship between features and target variables by creating a tree-like structure of decisions.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis is `Position_Salaries.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- **Position**: The job title of the employee.
- **Salary**: The corresponding salary of the employee.

## Data Exploration
The following steps were performed to explore the dataset:
- Loaded the dataset and checked for null values.
- Displayed the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.

## Model Training
A `DecisionTreeRegressor` from the `sklearn` library was used to model the data. The model was initialized with a random state of 101 and trained using the features (position levels) and target variable (salaries).

## Predictions
Predictions were made using the trained model. For example, the predicted salary for a position level of 6.5 is obtained using the following code:
```python
predicted_salary = regressor.predict([[6.5]])
```

## Visualization
The results were visualized using a scatter plot to show the actual data points and a line representing the predictions made by the model. The plot illustrates how the decision tree regression model fits the data.

## Conclusion
The decision tree regression model effectively predicts salaries based on position levels. Future work could involve exploring other regression techniques or tuning the model parameters for improved performance.
