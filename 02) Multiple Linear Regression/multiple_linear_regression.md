# Multiple Linear Regression Documentation

## Overview
Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It extends the simple linear regression model by allowing for more than one predictor.

## Purpose
The purpose of Multiple Linear Regression is to understand how the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied while the others are held constant. This model is particularly useful in scenarios where the outcome is influenced by several factors.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used for this model is `50_Startups.csv`, which contains information about various startups, including features such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
3. **Model Training**: The model is trained using the training dataset, where the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is established.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Conclusion
Multiple Linear Regression is a powerful tool for predicting outcomes based on multiple input features. It provides insights into the relationships between variables and can be used for various applications in business, economics, and social sciences.

## Future Work
Future enhancements may include exploring interaction terms, polynomial regression, and regularization techniques to improve model performance.
